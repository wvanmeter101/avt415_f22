		<h2>Paragraph indents</h2>
<br>
		<p style="text-indent: 50px">Separating paragraphs from one another is one of the most fundamental functions of typography. There’s two generally accepted solutions: either use a first-line indent or a margin between the paragraphs. Your readers (hopefully) aren’t stupid—they don’t need two signs that a new paragraph is happening, so never use both an indent and a margin. That would be redundant.</p>
		<p>The CSS text-indent property defines the size of the first-line indent of a particular element. </p>
		<br>
		<h2>Manageable Line Length</h2>
<br>
		<p style="text-indent: 50px; line-height: 1.6">You should try to limit the length of your lines to approximately 80 characters or less. It reduces strain on the reader’s eyes, since they don’t need to move back and forth as much. It also helps prevent them from jumping to the wrong line when they get to the end of the previous line. The end result is that it’s easier for visitors to digest your content.</p>
<br>
		<p>Don’t believe us? Try reading Wikipedia with a narrow browser window. It makes a big difference.</p>

		<p style="padding: 50px"><em>“Web typography” refers to the appearance of all the text on your website. It includes basic CSS text properties like what font to use and whether it should be italic or not, but typography is much more than that. It’s about the space between and around letters, words, and lines. It’s the size of different runs of text in relation to one another, and the history behind each font family.</em></p>

<br><br>

		<h4>"Woff" fonts</h4>
		<p style="padding: 50px">Recently, the industry has standardized on the Web Open Font Format (WOFF), so things have gotten a little bit simpler for us. Over 90% of modern browsers support .woff fonts, and support for its next evolution, .woff2, is growing. WOFF2 is similar to the original WOFF format, but offers a significant reduction in file size (which means better performance).</p>
		<p style="padding: 50px">Eventually, you’ll only need to support WOFF2, but right now, we suggest providing both WOFF and WOFF2 web fonts to get decent coverage for older browsers and improved performance on modern ones. Unless legacy browsers make up a large chunk of your target audience, .ttf, .svg, and .eot fonts are a thing of the past.</p>
	<!--1. Use locally hosted fonts for em, h3, h4, and p. 2. You may use different typefaces or different styles of the same font. 3. style the content. 4. list the name of your fonts.-->
